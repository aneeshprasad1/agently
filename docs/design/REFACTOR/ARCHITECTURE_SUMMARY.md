# Agently Architecture Refactor: Executive Summary

## The Problem

Currently, Agently has planning logic scattered across multiple components:
- **Swift**: `main.swift` handles execution, retry logic, and error recovery
- **Python**: `main.py` and `planner.py` handle LLM planning and conversation logging
- **Result**: Tight coupling, duplicated logic, hard to maintain and extend

## The Solution: Brain, Hands, and Eyes

### üß† Brain (Python)
- **Single source of truth** for all planning and reasoning
- **Tool-use pattern** to coordinate with Hands and Eyes
- **LLM orchestration** with sophisticated retry and recovery logic
- **Future-ready** for AutoGen multi-agent conversations

### üñêÔ∏è Hands (Swift)
- **Pure execution** - no planning logic
- **HTTP API** for Brain to call
- **Skills framework** for UI actions (click, type, scroll, etc.)
- **Performance monitoring** and error reporting

### üëÅÔ∏è Eyes (Swift)
- **Pure observation** - no planning logic
- **HTTP API** for Brain to call
- **Accessibility trees** and screenshots
- **Element finding** and UI state monitoring

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Brain handles all reasoning and planning
- Hands handles all execution
- Eyes handles all observation
- Clear interfaces between components

### 2. **Flexibility**
- All logic defined in prompts (no hardcoded strategies)
- Easy to add new skills and observation tools
- Support for complex reasoning chains
- Future AutoGen integration

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Single place to modify planning logic
- Easy to test individual components
- Better error handling and debugging
- Clear migration path

### 4. **Scalability**
- Components can be deployed independently
- Easy to add new Brain implementations
- Support for distributed execution
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Core Separation (2-3 weeks)
1. Extract Hands functionality from current Swift code
2. Extract Eyes functionality from current Swift code
3. Create HTTP API interfaces for both components
4. Implement basic Brain with tool use

### Phase 2: Tool Use Integration (2-3 weeks)
1. Implement comprehensive tool registry
2. Create standardized tool interfaces
3. Implement error handling and recovery
4. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Planning (3-4 weeks)
1. Implement sophisticated retry logic
2. Add context-aware planning
3. Implement multi-step reasoning
4. Add AutoGen integration for multi-agent conversations

### Phase 4: Performance & Reliability (2-3 weeks)
1. Add caching and optimization
2. Implement parallel execution where possible
3. Add comprehensive error recovery
4. Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Communication
- **HTTP APIs** for tool calls between Brain and Swift components
- **Standardized tool protocol** for consistent interaction
- **WebSocket support** for real-time updates (future)

### Tool Use Pattern
```python
# Brain sends tool call
result = await brain.execute_tool("click_element", element_id="elem_123", position="center")

# Hands/Eyes respond with standardized result
{
    "success": True,
    "data": {"clicked_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"},
    "error": None,
    "execution_time": 0.15
}
```

### Example Workflow
1. **Brain** receives task: "Save the document"
2. **Brain** calls **Eyes**: "Get current UI graph"
3. **Brain** analyzes context and plans: "Click save button"
4. **Brain** calls **Hands**: "Click element with label 'Save'"
5. **Hands** executes click and reports success
6. **Brain** verifies completion and reports success

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Gradual Migration**
- New components run alongside existing code
- Feature flags for new vs. old behavior
- Easy rollback if issues arise

### 2. **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing CLI interface maintained
- Gradual migration of functionality
- Comprehensive testing strategy

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Metrics for each component
- Performance regression detection
- A/B testing capabilities

## Success Metrics

### 1. **Code Quality**
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved test coverage
- Faster feature development

### 2. **System Reliability**
- Better error handling
- Improved recovery mechanisms
- Reduced failure rates

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Easier to add new features
- Better debugging capabilities
- Clearer code organization

### 4. **Future Readiness**
- AutoGen integration ready
- Multi-agent support
- Advanced reasoning capabilities

## Conclusion

This refactor transforms Agently from a tightly-coupled system with scattered planning logic into a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns and enables sophisticated reasoning. The tool-use pattern allows the Brain to orchestrate complex workflows while keeping components focused on their specific responsibilities.

The migration can be done gradually, ensuring stability while dramatically improving the overall system architecture and capabilities. The result is a more maintainable, flexible, and powerful automation system.
