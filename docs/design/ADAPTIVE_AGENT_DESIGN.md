## Evolution from Current Architecture

### Current State (Linear Execution)
```
Task Input → Single LLM Plan → Sequential Execution → Basic Recovery → End
```

**Limitations:**
- Static planning with no mid-execution adaptation
- LLM can't see intermediate results or UI changes
- Binary success/failure with limited recovery
- No learning between tasks
- No human guidance capabilities

### Target State (Adaptive Agent)
```
Task Input → Dynamic Planning → Intelligent Execution → Continuous Learning → Human Collaboration
```

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time plan adaptation based on execution results
- Multi-modal LLM participation (planning, reviewing, recovering)
- Progressive learning and skill abstraction
- Confidence-based decision making
- Human-in-the-loop for guidance and teaching

---

## Adaptive Agent Principles

### 1. **Reactive Intelligence**
- Continuously observe and adapt to changing UI states
- Re-plan when assumptions break or unexpected states occur
- Learn from both successes and failures

### 2. **Confidence-Driven Execution**
- Use confidence scores to determine execution path
- Escalate to LLM or human when confidence is low
- Build confidence through successful pattern recognition

### 3. **Hierarchical Task Management**
- Decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks
- Apply different strategies at different abstraction levels
- Enable parallel execution of independent sub-tasks

### 4. **Progressive Learning**
- Build reusable skill patterns from successful executions
- Adapt to application-specific UI patterns
- Learn user preferences and optimize for individual workflows

### 5. **Human-AI Collaboration**
- Seamlessly integrate human guidance when needed
- Learn from human demonstrations and corrections
- Provide transparent decision-making with human oversight

---

## Multi-Modal Execution Flows

### Flow Types by Confidence Level

```python
class ExecutionMode:
    AUTONOMOUS = "autonomous"       # High confidence, execute directly
    CONSULTATIVE = "consultative"   # Medium confidence, ask LLM first
    COLLABORATIVE = "collaborative" # Low confidence, involve human
    LEARNING = "learning"           # Unknown pattern, learn mode
```

### 1. **Autonomous Flow** (Confidence > 0.9)
```
Plan → Execute → Verify → Continue
```
- Direct execution of well-understood patterns
- Minimal LLM involvement for efficiency
- Used for learned skills and high-confidence actions

### 2. **Consultative Flow** (Confidence 0.7-0.9)
```
Plan → LLM Review → Modified Plan → Execute → Learn
```
- LLM reviews plan before execution
- Allows for real-time plan modification
- Builds confidence through successful consultations

### 3. **Collaborative Flow** (Confidence 0.5-0.7)
```
Plan → LLM Analysis → Human Approval → Execute → Record Feedback
```
- Human oversight for uncertain situations
- Builds training data for future similar scenarios
- Safe fallback for critical or risky actions

### 4. **Learning Flow** (Confidence < 0.5)
```
Analyze → Decompose → Human Demonstration → Record Pattern → Retry
```
- Human teaches the system new patterns
- Creates reusable skills for future tasks
- Expands system capabilities incrementally

---

## LLM Participation Patterns

### 1. **Strategic Planning**
- **When:** Initial task analysis and high-level planning
- **Prompt Pattern:**
```
Task: {user_task}
Current UI: {ui_summary}
Available Skills: {known_patterns}

Create a strategic plan with contingencies:
1. Primary approach
2. Alternative strategies
3. Risk assessment
4. Confidence estimates
```

### 2. **Real-Time Consultation**
- **When:** Before uncertain actions or after unexpected UI changes
- **Prompt Pattern:**
```
Current Action: {planned_action}
UI State: {current_ui}
Confidence: {confidence_score}
Context: {execution_history}

Should I:
1. Proceed as planned
2. Modify the action
3. Take different approach
4. Request human guidance

Reasoning: ...
```

### 3. **Progress Review**
- **When:** After significant milestones or every N actions
- **Prompt Pattern:**
```
Task Progress:
- Original goal: {task}
- Completed: {completed_actions}
- Current state: {ui_state}
- Remaining plan: {remaining_actions}

Assessment:
1. Are we on track?
2. Should we adjust strategy?
3. Any risks or opportunities?
```

### 4. **Error Recovery**
- **When:** Action failures or unexpected system states
- **Prompt Pattern:**
```
Failure Context:
- Failed action: {action}
- Error: {error_message}
- UI state: {current_ui}
- Execution history: {context}

Recovery Options:
1. Retry with modifications
2. Alternative approach
3. Escalate to human
4. Abort and report

Recommended strategy: ...
```

## Learning & Abstraction System

### Pattern Recognition Engine

```python
class PatternLearner:
    def observe_execution(self, action_sequence, ui_states, outcome):
        """Record successful/failed patterns for learning"""
        
    def identify_patterns(self):
        """Find common successful action sequences"""
        
    def build_abstractions(self):
        """Create reusable skills from patterns"""
        
    def predict_confidence(self, action, context):
        """Estimate success probability based on learned patterns"""
```

### Skill Abstraction Levels

#### **1. Atomic Actions** (Current)
```json
{
  "type": "click",
  "target": "submit_button",
  "parameters": {"x": 100, "y": 200}
}
```

#### **2. Learned Micro-Skills** (New)
```json
{
  "type": "micro_skill",
  "name": "fill_email_recipient",
  "pattern": [
    {"type": "click", "target": "to_field"},
    {"type": "wait", "condition": "field_focused"},
    {"type": "type", "text": "{recipient}"},
    {"type": "key_press", "key": "tab"}
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

#### **3. Composed Skills** (Advanced)
```json
{
  "type": "composed_skill",
  "name": "compose_email",
  "sub_skills": [
    "open_compose_window",
    "fill_email_recipient", 
    "fill_email_subject",
    "fill_email_body",
    "send_email"
  ],
  "conditions": ["mail_app_active"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### Learning Mechanisms

- Build predictive models for action success
- Update confidence based on recent performance

#### **3. Skill Composition**
- Automatically combine successful atomic actions
- Create parameterized skill templates
- Version and improve skills over time

#### **4. Contextual Adaptation**
- Learn when to apply which skills
- Adapt to different applications and UI layouts
- Personalize for individual user preferences

## Human-in-the-Loop Integration

### Human Participation Modes

#### **1. Approval Gates**
- **Purpose:** Safety and quality control
- **Trigger:** High-risk actions, financial transactions, data deletion
- **Interface:** Show planned action, request approval/modification

#### **2. Learning Mode**
- **Purpose:** Teach new skills and patterns
- **Trigger:** Unknown UI elements, failed action recovery
- **Interface:** Screen recording, action demonstration, pattern annotation

#### **3. Clarification Requests**
- **Purpose:** Resolve ambiguous instructions
- **Trigger:** Multiple valid interpretations, unclear user intent
- **Interface:** Present options, request selection with reasoning

#### **4. Quality Review**
- **Purpose:** Validate task completion and outcomes
- **Trigger:** Complex multi-step tasks, critical business processes
- **Interface:** Show before/after states, request confirmation

#### **5. Override Mode**
- **Purpose:** Human takes control when automation fails
- **Trigger:** Repeated failures, user request, emergency situations
- **Interface:** Pass control to human, record actions for learning

### Human Feedback Collection

```python
class HumanFeedbackManager:
    async def request_approval(self, action, context, risk_level):
        """Request human approval for risky actions"""
        
    async def collect_demonstration(self, failed_context):
        """Human demonstrates correct approach"""
        
    async def gather_preference(self, options, context):
        """Human selects preferred approach with reasoning"""
        
    async def validate_outcome(self, task, execution_result):
        """Human confirms task was completed correctly"""
        
    async def collect_correction(self, action, outcome, expected):
        """Human provides corrective guidance"""
```

### Learning from Human Feedback

#### **Immediate Learning**
- Update action confidence based on approvals/rejections
- Record demonstrated action sequences as new patterns
- Adjust decision thresholds based on human preferences

#### **Pattern Generalization**
- Extract general principles from specific corrections
- Apply learnings to similar contexts and applications
- Build user-specific preference models
